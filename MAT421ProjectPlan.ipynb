        "\n",
        "*   Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate identification of individuals at higher risk is critical for effective preventative measures, treatment planning, and resource allocation in healthcare. Data‐driven approaches, particularly machine learning (ML), offer a promising avenue for risk stratification and decision support, enabling clinicians to pinpoint key indicators and make more informed judgments.\n",
        "*   In this project, my primary focus is to construct and evaluate machine learning models that predict the likelihood of heart disease using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. Through this process, I will not only compare multiple algorithms’ predictive power but also investigate which features are most indicative of heart disease. By doing so, I hope to provide insights that may guide clinical practice and further research into risk factors.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   Numerous studies have explored predictive modeling for heart disease, often relying on commonly used classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. More recently, advanced ensemble methods like XGBoost and LightGBM have demonstrated strong performance, often surpassing single‐model approaches. However, much of the existing literature either examines relatively small datasets or focuses on maximizing accuracy without thoroughly discussing interpretability—a key concern in healthcare contexts.\n",
        "*   Additionally, some papers have looked into deep neural networks, though these methods can be difficult to interpret compared to tree‐based or linear models. Researchers have also explored various feature selection techniques to mitigate data noise and overfitting, employing metrics like correlation coefficients or more sophisticated methods (e.g., recursive feature elimination). Despite these efforts, there is room for a unified approach that compares a wide range of techniques in terms of both accuracy and explainability, using a consistent dataset and evaluation protocol.\n",
